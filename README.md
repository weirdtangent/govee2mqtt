A few notes:
* Govee's API is SLOW. Not only does each request take longer than it should, it takes, sometimes, 3 to 4 seconds for the command to reach the light strip.
* If you have many (10+) Govee devices, you will need to raise the GOVEE_DEVICE_INTERVAL setting because of their daily limit of API requests.
* Support is there for power on/off, brightness, and rgb_color.

  ## Buy Me A Coffee

A few people have kindly requested a way to donate a small amount of money. If you feel so inclined I've set up a "Buy Me A Coffee"
page where you can donate a small sum. Please do not feel obligated to donate in any way - I work on the app because it's
useful to myself and others, not for any financial gain - but any token of appreciation is much appreciated ðŸ™‚
