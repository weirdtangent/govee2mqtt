# Trivy ignore file for govee2mqtt
# Filters out base image vulnerabilities that don't apply to a Python MQTT application
#
# This application is a Python-based MQTT bridge that:
# - Doesn't use system command-line utilities (tar, perl, util-linux, etc.)
# - Doesn't call curl/libssh/GnuTLS binaries (Python has native libraries)
# - Doesn't use databases (sqlite) or XML parsing (expat)
# - Runs in an ephemeral container with no persistent storage or shell access
#
# NOTE: These CVEs may have any upstream severity rating, but are assessed as
# low/no risk for this specific application context after manual review.

# ============================================================================
# SYSTEM UTILITIES - Command-line tools not invoked by Python app
# ============================================================================

# util-linux - System utilities like login, su, mount
# Python app doesn't interact with user management or filesystem mounting
CVE-2025-23744
CVE-2024-28085

# tar - Only used during Docker build, not at runtime
CVE-1999-1572
CVE-2005-2541

# perl - Not used by Python application
CVE-2011-4116
CVE-2023-31484
CVE-2023-31486

# sysvinit - Init system issues don't apply to containerized processes
CVE-2018-20482

# ============================================================================
# NETWORK LIBRARIES - Binaries/CLI tools not invoked
# ============================================================================

# curl/libcurl - The curl CLI tool is not invoked by this application
# Python uses native urllib3/aiohttp, not subprocess calls to curl
CVE-2024-9681
CVE-2025-0359
CVE-2025-0594
CVE-2024-8096

# libssh - SSH protocol library and tools not used by MQTT application
# paho-mqtt only uses TCP or TLS connections, not SSH

CVE-2023-6918
CVE-2023-48795
CVE-2023-1667
CVE-2023-2283

# GnuTLS - This TLS library is not used (Python uses OpenSSL bindings)
CVE-2024-0567
CVE-2024-0553

# ============================================================================
# PARSING LIBRARIES - Not used by this application
# ============================================================================

# libexpat - Only matters if parsing XML (we use JSON, not XML)

CVE-2024-50602
CVE-2023-52425
CVE-2023-52426

# sqlite - Database not used in this application (stateless MQTT bridge)
CVE-2024-5470
CVE-2023-7104

# ============================================================================
# COMPILER/BUILD TOOLS - Only present during build, not runtime
# ============================================================================

# gcc/binutils - Build-time only, not in runtime container
CVE-2023-4039
CVE-2022-27943

# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: OpenSSL CVEs are NOT ignored
# ============================================================================
# Python's ssl module wraps OpenSSL, so OpenSSL CVEs CAN affect this application
# when TLS is enabled for MQTT connections. OpenSSL CVEs must be reviewed and
# patched via base image updates (apt-get upgrade), not ignored here.
