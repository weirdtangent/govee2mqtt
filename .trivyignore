# Trivy ignore file for govee2mqtt
# Filters out base image vulnerabilities that don't apply to a Python MQTT application
#
# This application is a Python-based MQTT bridge that:
# - Doesn't use system utilities (tar, perl, util-linux, etc.)
# - Doesn't use network utilities (curl, libssh, openssl outside of Python)
# - Doesn't use databases (sqlite, expat for XML)
# - Runs in an ephemeral container with no persistent storage or shell access

# ============================================================================
# MEDIUM/LOW SEVERITY - Not actionable for this use case
# ============================================================================
# These will be filtered by workflow severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
# But documented here for completeness

# ============================================================================
# SYSTEM UTILITIES - Not used by Python application
# ============================================================================

# util-linux - System utilities like login, su, mount
# Python app doesn't interact with user management or filesystem mounting
